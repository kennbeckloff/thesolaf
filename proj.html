    <p>We Foster an understanding of the amenity, ecological and economic value of trees to the community.We also address the downward spiral of deforestation, land degradation, soil infertility, reduced yields, food insecurity, increasing poverty and malnutrition in Kenya.The project demonstrates the effectiveness and the sustainability of locally owned solutions to food insecurity. Solutions that recognise and address the different causal factors: environmental degradation, economic exclusion and political powerlessness.      
Forests and trees are also the backbone of many important economic activities. They are the source of virtually all the nation's supply of building timber, poles, veneers and plywood, wood-fuel, pulp and paper. Other commodities and services from forests and trees include fruits, oils, tannins, resins, medicines, fibre, shade, browse and fodder. The last three are of particular importance to man and livestock, especially in the arid and semi-arid land areas.Kenya has a small area of reserved forest estate (about 7%). The bulk of the forest estate (200 million ha) support the indigenous forests which provide protective functions as well as yielding wood of high commercial value. Plantations forests (about 0.15 million ha) provide the bulk of wood demand for domestic and commercial need.</p>


<h3><u><strong style="color: green">The choice of species for planting depends on</strong></u></h3>
<p>
1) The purpose of planting: Species selected must be able to fulfill the objective for planting them - e.g. soil and water conservation - in catchment areas, improvement of soil fertility (supply of mulching material, green manure), animal fodder, shade, and saleable products such as fruits, fire wood and charcoal, timber for construction, craft materials, etc.
2) The environment e.g. climatic conditions, soil type and altitude
3) The ability of the species to establish and provide a wide range of utility, preferable for more than one purpose and a high degree of profitability.Availability of good quality seed on time is a pre-requisite for all tree planting activities. The Kenya Tree Seed Centre, a programme within KEFRI, supplies good quality seed.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Home garden production of vegetables has improve food supply and family nutrition in our communities. However, production is limited by a number of factors, including competition for land area with other crops, lack of skills in preparation for consumption and storage, unavailability of seed and lack of appropriate husbandry practices. Farm families also point to the difficulty of securing a market when they have a surplus, especially in the rainy season. These problems can be overcome, but lack of awareness of their nutritive value and the general notion that African traditional vegetables are 'backward' has led to research into the improvement of African vegetables being a low priority.Thesolaf in partenership with Spririt in Action has in the past help community residents i  the western Region grow Vegatables and fruits that later has enable them earn a living through the sales.Most vegetable production is rain-fed. In the dry season, people adopt risk-avoidance strategies to meet vegetable needs. This includes production along riverbanks and supplementary watering. Cucurbits are drought tolerant and once established they are harvested all the year round. They therefore provide the main accompaniment to ugali for families whose farms do not border rivers.For anyone interested in rural women's welfare, African traditional vegetables offer an important entry point. These vegetables provide an important economic pillar upon which women's rural livelihood is supported.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The nursery attendant works together with our volunteers at the tree units.They are responsible for preparing the seedlings,socketing and prunning.
      Our main objective is to plant about 6-8 milliion trees in our community to fight deforestation and observe environmental conservation.Since 2005 we have been able to plant 2.6 million trees in diffrent places within the western Region.Although we are beeing hampered by lack of enough funds to succesfully run our projects but slowly by slowly envolvement of community members to our project has also accelerated the planting of more species of trees..</p>

      <h2 style="color: green"><b>BANANA FARMING</b></h2>
      <p>Above is The harvested banana fruits ready for market at THESOLAF banana plantation.  <br>
        Banana fruits in Kenya are extensively cultivated as a staple food and also as an income generating activity by many local communities. However the main problem with banana farming in Kenya is that bananas in Kenya are easily prone to diseases that affect the yield and lead to profit loss and sustenance for the farmer and lack of capital to effectively buy pesticides.
      Thesolaf working with Spirit in Action has in the Past helped farmers and the community on the importance of this fruit.Today it is grown on large scale.</p>

        <quote><i>A forest ecology is a delicate one. If the forest perishes, its fauna may go with it. The athshean word for world is also the word for forest. <br>

        A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people. 
        <br>

        If the forest has a day of fire and the heat of the flames does not consume a special tree, it will still be changed; charred, but still standing.</i>  </quote>
