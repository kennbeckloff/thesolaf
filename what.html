  <h3><b> FIGHTING HIV/AIDS</b></h3><br>  
  <p>The Society of Lake Fishers on AIDS (THESOLAF) has recorded success in reducing high HIV infection rates is the result of high-level political and community commitment to HIV prevention and care, involving a wide range of partners and all sectors of society. Same-day results for HIV tests and social marketing of condoms and self-treatment kits for sexually transmitted infections, backed up by sex education programmes, have helped reduce very high HIV infection rates.</p>
  <p>Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, are the first African countries in sub-Saharan Africa to experience the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS and to take action to control the epidemic, is one of the rare success stories in a region that has been ravaged by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While the rate of new infections continues to increase in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya, and Uganda has succeeded in lowering its very high infection rates through Government sponsored projects and NGO’s. THESOLAF reports that since 2004 HIV infection rates among pregnant women, a key indicator of the progress of the epidemic, have been more than halved in some areas and infection rates among men seeking treatment for sexually transmitted infections have dropped by over a third within the regions of Nyanza in Kenya and Jinja Uganda where it operates.</p>
   <div class="w3-container">
   <p class="w3-dropdown-hover">More!
    <span class="w3-dropdown-content w3-green w3-padding">In the city Kisumu, the level of HIV infection among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics fell from 31% in 2001 to 14% by 2006. Meanwhile, outside Kisumu, infection rates among pregnant women under 20 dropped from 21% in 2002 to 8% in 2006. Elsewhere, among men attending STI clinics, HIV infection rates fell from 46% in 2003 to 30% in 2010.Success in reducing the prevalence of HIV in Kenya and Uganda is the result of a broad-based community and national effort backed up by firm political commitment, including the personal involvement of the heads of these states. From the outset, the government involved religious and traditional leaders, community groups, NGOs, and all sectors of society, forging a consensus around the need to contain the escalating spread of HIV and provide care and support for those affected on which THASOLAF was working on. 
Sex education programmes in schools and on the public video focused on the need to negotiate safe sex and encouraged teenagers to delay the age at which they first have sex. Since 2001, a MERCURY PHOENIX TRUST -funded scheme to increase condom use through free distribution  of condoms which boosted condom use from 7% region wide to over 50% in rural areas and over 85% in urban areas of Lake Victoria and within the Lake Victoria fishermen beaches. The free distribution by both the government and the THESOLAF saw the community respond accurately by freely picking them from public stands placed allover social places. The scheme was also backed up by health education and other public information. Meanwhile more teenage girls reported condom use than any other age group -- a trend reflected in falling infection rates among 13-19 year old girls in Kisumu town and its environ together with the  rural areas of Kisumu. And among 15-year-old boys and girls, the proportion who had never had sex rose from about 20% to 50% between 2002 and 2010.Condom use is also being encouraged among men who seek treatment for sexually transmitted infections. A new innovative social marketing scheme to promote the use of an STI self- treatment kit ("Clear Seven") has proved to be successful in treating STIs and preventing HIV infection. The kit, which contains a 14-day course of tablets, condoms, partner referral cards, and an information leaflet, is designed to improve STI treatment rates, prevent over-the-counter sales of inappropriate treatments, encourage partner referral, and reinforce condom use.The distribution system relies on the use of small retail outlets which are normally licensed to sell over-the-counter drugs but not antibiotics. THESOLAF also informed the general public at the Community level the  Kenya Government has waived these restrictions to promote sales of Clear Seven, marketed at the subsidized price of US$ 1.35, and trained shopkeepers in the management of STIs. As a result, cure rates for urethritis have increased from 46% to 87% and condom use during treatment has more than doubled (from 32% to 65%). Another innovation in THESOLAF was the launch in 2003 of same-day voluntary counseling and testing services. Up till then, clients had to wait two weeks for their HIV test results and up to 30% failed to return. Thousands of people who have taken advantage of same-day testing have since been recruited and trained as peer educators. So far, 180 000 people have been reached by the scheme and over a million condoms distributed.In Kenya and  Uganda, as elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS has caused immense human suffering over the past two decades -- setting back development and reducing life expectancy. Over 1.5 million children have been orphaned since the epidemic began -- losing their mother or both parents to AIDS. Today there is hope that the tide can be turned at last. THESOLAF wishes to continue with its advocacy against the spread of HIV/AIDS and Home Based Care:</p>

  <h3><b>EDUCATION</b></h3><br>
  <i class="fa fa-css3 w3-margin-bottom w3-text-theme" style="font-size:120px"></i>
  <p>Thesolaf is working under different solution to provide education to the poor and also to those in the orphanage.Poverty which can be defined in terms of extreme, moderate and relative poverty is a threat to existence of humanity in modern times especially in the developing world. Worst hit are countries in Sub -Saharan Africa. The millennium development agenda set to reduce poverty by a half by the year 2015.This expresses the global commitment in ensuring that the living standards of mankind. In Kenya the wish to alleviate poverty has been articulated since independence through various sessional papers, commissions, taskforces and development plans. Several proposals have been made in these documents on how to reduce poverty. However, the challenges of poverty still abound in Kenya. These challenges threaten provision of social services among majority of Kenyans who total about 56%. One of the basic social services which are highly threatened is the provision of quality education. This paper articulates the issue of poverty in provision of quality education. Causes, characteristics, and effects of poverty in Kenya are discussed. Indictors of quality education are discussed along with the govern-ment's efforts to reduce poverty and realize provision of education to most of the deserving citizens. Conclusions are drawn from the discussions and recommendation made on how best to address the affects of poverty in the provision of quality education.

  <h3><B>ORPHANAGE</B></h3><br>
  <i class="fa fa-diamond w3-margin-bottom w3-text-theme" style="font-size:120px"></i>
  <p>The primary goal of the project is to restore hope and provision of basic needs to orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya. Thesolaf Children’s Home takes care of destitute, orphaned and abandoned children.
  The objectives are to rehabilitate the children with interpersonal development skills through education, medical care, building of their self-esteem and social living skills.

  The project has a feeding program where it ensures that children get a well balanced diet and three meals a day. In response to the millennium development goals for 2015 the project has endeavoured to provide education needs to all the children in the home. We have pre-school, primary and secondary pupils. With our dormitories and the main family house we provide shelter for all the children. They are living together as brothers and sisters under the care of two parents. The program provides clothing and school uniforms to the children. Medical care is provided to all children. The home provides on going psychosocial counselling for the children through networking with pro-bono counsellors who provide invaluable counselling to the children. We have income generating activities as the home has four milk cows (Friesian) that provide milk to sell locally, supplementing the Home’s already strained budget.
